This is the source of https://hitobito.readthedocs.io a generic user documenation about hitobito.

We try to have a better solution to handle all the documentation. A challenge is that every organisation has specific custom things, they need to have adressed. To have a common core of documentation with extensions for the different organization, we will try this git-based approach with Sphinx.

Every organization will have their own branch in the git repo. We will the merge selectively from the master and adjust locally on the branch what is different.

We will have to see if this a practicable approach, as we will have to merge very selectively.

This will be built with https://readthedocs.org/

A helpful overview over the restructured syntax that we use can be found here: http://docs.sphinxdocs.com/en/latest/step-1.html
